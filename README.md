# Classifying-Potentially-Hazardous-Asteroids-
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify potentially hazardous asteroids using a dataset provided by NASA. The model's purpose is to detect asteroids that pose a risk of collision with Earth by identifying those susceptible to gravitational disturbances that can alter their orbits as they revolve around the Sun. By detecting these hazards early, appropriate measures can be taken to mitigate the potential dangers.

## Project Stages

### The project involves several essential stages:

1. - Data Inspection and Cleaning:
Thoroughly inspect the dataset provided by NASA, addressing any inconsistencies, missing values, or anomalies.
Clean the dataset to ensure data quality and reliability for further analysis.

2. - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct EDA to gain insights into the characteristics and patterns of potentially hazardous asteroids.
Utilize visualizations, statistical analyses, and correlation studies to uncover valuable trends and relationships within the data.

3. - Data Preprocessing:
Perform data preprocessing tasks, including feature engineering, normalization, and handling categorical variables as needed.
Prepare the dataset to be suitable for model development.

4. - Model Building and Training:
Build and train a machine learning model using appropriate algorithms to classify asteroids as potentially hazardous or non-hazardous.
Implement iterative evaluation and optimization techniques to achieve the best model performance.
