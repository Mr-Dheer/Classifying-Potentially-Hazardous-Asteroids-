# Classifying-Potentially-Hazardous-Asteroids-
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify potentially hazardous asteroids using a dataset provided by NASA. 
The model's purpose is to detect asteroids that pose a risk of collision with Earth by identifying those susceptible to gravitational disturbances that can alter their orbits as they revolve around the Sun. By detecting these hazards early, appropriate measures can be taken to mitigate the potential dangers.

### Analysis
All the analysis conducted and techniques applied are  documented and stored in the attached PowerPoint file


## Project Stages

### The project involves several essential stages:

1. - **Data Inspection and Cleaning:**
Thoroughly inspected the dataset provided by NASA, addressing any inconsistencies, missing values, or anomalies.
Cleaned the dataset to ensure data quality and reliability for further analysis.

2. - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Conducted EDA to gain insights into the characteristics and patterns of potentially hazardous asteroids.
Utilized visualizations, statistical analyses, and correlation studies to uncover valuable trends and relationships within the data.

3. - **Data Preprocessing:**
Performed data preprocessing tasks, including feature engineering, normalization, and handling categorical variables as needed.
Prepared the dataset to be suitable for model development.

4. - **Model Building and Training:**
Buit and trained a machine learning model using appropriate algorithms to classify asteroids as potentially hazardous or non-hazardous.
Implemented iterative evaluation and optimization techniques to achieve the best model performance.
